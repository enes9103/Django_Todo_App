# Django-Todolist

Django-Todolist is a todolist web application with the most basic features of most web apps, i.e. accounts/login, API and (somewhat) interactive UI.

I've also build a quite similar app in Flask: https://github.com/enes9103/Django_Todo_App


## Explore
Try it out by installing the requirements. (Works only with python >= 3.8, due to Django 4)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Migrate:

    python manage.py migrate

And then start the server (default: http://localhost:8000)

    python manage.py runserver


Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/)
or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/)
